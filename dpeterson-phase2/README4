#### FILE DESCRIPTIONS
a.sql - The 'a.sql' file contains SQL queries that retrieve wanted information from the database, 
answering specific questions related to candidate applications, salaries, faculty capacity, candidate 
qualifications, and departmental statistics. 

b.sql - The 'b.sql' file contains five SQL data modification commands that utilize advanced features 
such as updating multiple tuples, deleting specific sets of tuples, and inserting query results. 

c.sql - The 'c.sql' file generates two purposeful views within the database, facilitating efficient data analysis and retrieval.
Additionally, it includes queries utilizing these views, limited by the LIMIT clause for concise output, while the 

'dropschema.sql' - script is updated to ensure the CASCADE option is applied for seamless removal of associated elements.

d.sql - The 'd.sql' file creates and drops the indexes and shows the time comparisons. 

createschema.sql:
  - Keys and Foreign Keys: created keys for each of the tables that are in the database, ssn for Candidates, job_id for jobs, application_id for applications, letter_id for letters,
    and name for departments. We also included a foreign key for for Applications (job_id) that references Jobs.
  - Checks: We included checks for Candidates include guaranteeing age over 18, and years_of_experience being > 1. For Letters we made sure that the letter types were either 'Rejection' or 'Offer'
    to ensure that we actually received a proper letter. For Departments we also included the fact that the maximum capacity for people cannot be exceeded.

triggerfunctions.sql:
  - Procedure: Our procedure works to find the number of unutilized jobs for each department by finding the max_faculty_capacity and subtracting both the current_number_of_faculty and openings.
    - Query: Tries to find the departments with unutilized positions greater than 5, to alert those departments that they need to hire more faculty. 
  - Trigger:
    - Query:
